###### On-line detection of price impact in limit order books


We present a measurement of price impact in a limit order book. 
This measurement is pathwise and on-line,
namely it can be performed while the execution is unfolding.

We model every price level of a limit order book as a queuing process, 
and
we apply the theory of innovation from stochastic filtering 
to give a benchmark for the time-evolving number of orders sitting at every price level.
It is from the comparison between 
the actual size of the price level queues 
and such benchmarks 
that we measure the price impact. 

In other words, 
the impact that a liquidator might have on the configuration of a limit order book
is linked to the deviation of 
the actual bid orders during the liquidation 
from 
their distributional features.
